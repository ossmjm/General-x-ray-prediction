# Health X-ray Pro

## Project Overview
Health X-ray Pro is an innovative solution for comprehensive medical X-ray analysis. Our project seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for image analysis and a LangChain chatbot for interactive, informative conversations. The goal is to provide patients with detailed insights into their medical conditions, fostering a better understanding of their health issues.

## Project Components

### 1. CNN Models (Convolutional Neural Networks)
Our system employs state-of-the-art CNN models for the initial classification of medical conditions based on X-ray images. CNNs excel in image analysis tasks, making them ideal for interpreting X-ray images and providing preliminary diagnoses.

### 2. LangChain Chatbot Model
Following the CNN-based diagnosis, the LangChain chatbot model takes over. This chatbot is designed to facilitate a conversational interface, allowing patients to interact and inquire about their specific medical conditions. It acts as a knowledge base, offering detailed information and responses to user queries, enhancing patient engagement and understanding.

## How It Works
1. **Image Analysis with CNN:**
   - X-ray images are processed through CNN models for preliminary medical condition identification.
  
2. **LangChain Chatbot Interaction:**
   - Identified medical conditions are passed to the LangChain chatbot.
   - Patients can engage in interactive conversations with the chatbot to gain more insights into their health concerns.

## Instructions

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. **CNN Models:**
   - Implement the CNN models for X-ray image analysis.

3. **LangChain Chatbot:**
   - Set up the LangChain chatbot for interactive conversations.

4. **Integration:**
   - Integrate CNN models and the LangChain chatbot to create the Health X-ray Pro system.
